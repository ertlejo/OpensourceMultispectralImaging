This is the final development of a project started by Dr. Marc van Iersel in the University of Georgia Horticulture Physiology Lab, with Dr. Changhyeon Kim, Dr. Mark Haidekker, Dr. Lynne Seymour, Ben Sidore and Changhyeon Kim with supervision from Dr. Rhuanito Ferrarezi. The goal is to assemble code and hardware to serve as a starting place for researchers to build from to make the tools they need for multipsectral plant imaging, using chlorophyll fluorescence to segment the plant area from the background to allow for plant-only analysis. This system uses a monochrome camera to collect the images, allowing for spectra to be controlled by light supply control. 
John Ertle is modifying this project to eventually scale into larger systems.
