This is the final development of a project started by Dr. Marc van Iersel in the University of Georgia Horticulture Physiology Lab, with Ben Sidore, Changhyeon Kim, Dr. Mark Haidekker, Dr. Lynne Seymour and myself with supervision from Dr. Rhuanito Ferrarezi. The goal is to assemble code and hardware to serve as a starting place for researchers to build from to make the tools they need for multipsectral plant imaging, using chlorophyll fluorescence to segment the plant area from the background to allow for plant-only analysis. This system uses a monochrome camera to collect the images, allowing for spectra to be controlled by light supply control. This process is based on a raspberry pi 4b, and built into a standard grow tent.
